# Navigating the Tech Industry as a First-Generation

## Introduction and Background
Growing up as a first-generation student, I often felt like I was straddling two different worlds: the life my parents envisioned for our family when they emigrated from Bangladesh and the harsh realities of establishing ourselves in America. These worlds coincided mostly during my high school years when I realized that the challenges my family faced were not just financial but also deeply personal. Reflecting on these experiences, I can see how they have shaped my resilience, determination, and the drive that now fuels my passion for my career.

## Family Struggles and Resilience
When I was 16, my father's health took a dramatic turn for the worse. He needed open-heart surgery, and the one who had always been a pillar of strength in my life suddenly seemed so fragile. Watching him struggle was terrifying; I felt helpless as I witnessed his deteriorating condition day by day. At the same time, my mother, already working two jobs, took on a third to keep our family afloat. Her unwavering dedication and strength in the face of such adversity were both inspiring and heartbreaking. The bright yellow taxi my father used to drive—a symbol of his relentless work ethic—became a reminder of the sacrifices my parents made. What I once saw as an embarrassing reflection of our financial situation, I now recognized as the vehicle that had sustained us for years.

These experiences taught me the value of perseverance and responsibility. Instead of letting fear and anxiety overwhelm me, I channeled those emotions into my studies, achieving high honors during one of the most difficult periods of my life. My father’s illness was a turning point; it pushed me to succeed not just for myself but for my family.

## Limited Opportunities and Personal Growth
Reflecting on my earlier years, I realize that the lack of extracurricular opportunities was another significant challenge. My school didn’t offer the clubs or after-school activities that many of my peers took for granted, and our community didn’t have the resources to fill those gaps. This absence of structured support meant that I had to carve my own path, often without guidance. However, this also taught me to be resourceful and self-motivated—qualities that would later drive my passion for technology and learning.

I remember how I used to feel embarrassed by my circumstances, worried that my peers would judge me for the life I led. But over time, I came to understand that these very challenges were shaping me into a person capable of navigating adversity with grit. My family's struggles were not a source of shame, but a testament to our resilience and the strength it takes to pursue a better life against the odds.

## Internship at Red Hat
Securing an internship at Red Hat was a pivotal moment in my career, but the journey to get there was far from straightforward. While studying abroad in Singapore, I had to navigate significant time zone differences and balance my coursework at the National University of Singapore (NUS) with the demands of the internship application process. This required not only meticulous planning but also a relentless commitment to seizing the opportunity. The challenges I faced along the way made me channel lots of perseverance, and securing the internship was a milestone of the hard work that I had put in.
At Red Hat, I was tasked with a project that aimed to use large language models (LLMs) to help identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities (CVEs) at a function-level, generating a security checklist as an intermediary step. This project was at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity, making it both challenging and impactful. I wasn’t alone in this project; I collaborated closely with a fellow intern and other interns on my team, and together, we navigated the complexities of the project, learned from each other, and leveraged our combined strengths to push the project forward.
One of the most thrilling aspects was the chance to collaborate with some of the brightest minds in the industry. Working closely with the application engineering and product security teams at Red Hat, allowed us to see how cross-functional teams can come together to solve complex problems. Specifically, we were involved in implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, a crucial component for scaling our software supply chain analyzer project. Testing this solution on three real OpenShift repositories was particularly gratifying because it validated that our application could work effectively on real production code for a core Red Hat product. This wasn’t just a technical task; it was a deep dive into understanding how different technologies and expertise can be integrated to create a solution that is greater than the sum of its parts. This collaboration enhanced my ability to think strategically about how to apply technology in real-world scenarios.
Another exciting aspect of this collaboration was integrating NVIDIA’s Morpheus SDK into our project. This experience provided us with hands-on exposure to a cutting-edge framework specialized in cybersecurity data, allowing us to enhance our solution’s accuracy and modularity. By incorporating LLM Agents, such as SBOM scanners and chain of thought prompting for each checklist item, we were able to significantly improve the precision of our final decision-making and classification processes. The opportunity to directly engage with NVIDIA engineers and explore the NVIDIA Morpheus SDK was certainly a highlight as it deepened our understanding of how AI can be leveraged to address and improve product security workflows.
But the learning didn’t stop there. One of the most insightful experiences was conducting a customer-facing interview with Robb, an engineer on the product security team. This wasn’t just a routine task—it was an eye-opening conversation that gave us a deeper understanding of the intricate processes and collaboration within the product security team. Robb’s insights into the daily challenges and strategic thinking involved in his role gave us a deeper understanding of how different parts of the Product Security team work together. For instance, after a security vulnerability is detected, the team must determine if it is exploitable, which is followed by a separate, detailed process to develop effective remediations. Robb also exposed us to the complexities of analyzing code for vulnerabilities and then transitioning to the remediation phase, which is an entirely distinct process within the product security team. This experience was invaluable as it taught us an essential workflow to maintaining robust product security.
The dynamic, startup-like atmosphere during our internship at Red Hat also meant that we had to continuously present our work to stakeholders. The weekly demos I gave to my project manager were more than just updates; they were opportunities to refine my communication and presentation skills. Each demo pushed me to clearly articulate complex ideas and receive critical feedback, which was instrumental in my professional development. This experience culminated in a final, gamified "VC Pitch" to an executive panel, including senior leadership and the COO, where we had to succinctly convey the value of our project in a high-stakes environment. These presentations have definitely sharpened my ability to pitch ideas convincingly and respond to questions on the spot, which are skills that are crucial in any career.
Beyond the technical and professional growth, what truly made my time at Red Hat special was the sense of community. The weekly in-office lunches were more than just meals—they were opportunities to connect with colleagues, share ideas, and gain insights from some of the brightest minds in the industry. These informal gatherings helped me feel integrated into the Red Hat culture, making me not just an intern, but a part of the Red Hat and open-source community. The discussions during these lunches often sparked new ideas and perspectives, which I could then bring back to my work, enriching my experience even further.
In summary, my internship at Red Hat was a transformative experience that went far beyond coding. It was an opportunity to learn from industry leaders, collaborate on innovative solutions, and integrate myself into a community of passionate, driven professionals. Each challenge I faced and every success I achieved reinforced my belief that with determination and the right opportunities, growth and success are always within reach. This internship wasn’t just a step in my career—it was a leap forward, fueled by the support, mentorship, and opportunities that Red Hat provided.

## Reflection
As I reflect on my journey, I am struck by how each challenge has shaped me into who I am today. My father’s illness, my mother’s sacrifices, the lack of opportunities in my youth—each of these experiences has taught me invaluable lessons about resilience, perseverance, and the importance of never giving up. My internship at Red Hat solidified these lessons, showing me how they apply in a professional context and how they can be leveraged to drive success.

Looking ahead, I am committed to leveraging these experiences to make a positive impact in the tech industry. I want to inspire other first-generation students to pursue their dreams, to show them that their circumstances do not define them, and that with hard work and support, anything is possible.

The bright yellow taxi that once made me anxious now serves as a symbol of growth. Every time I see one, I am reminded of my tenacity, the love I have for my family, and the journey that has brought me to where I am today. My story is not just about overcoming adversity; it is about embracing it as a part of who I am and using it to propel myself forward.
